This page will guide you through some of the basic use cases where
Deirokay can make your life easier when you are looking for a data quality tool.
At the end you will be familiar with the most features that comes with Deirokay.

Facing data quality issues
==========================

In any data-driven company, there comes a time when data processing and 
validation becomes a bottleneck for data products. It is usual for any company 
to have a lot of data sources such as databases, file systems, object storage systems,
data generated by certain processes, and so on.

Let's start simple, with a single CSV file, which will show how Deirokay can help you.

Suppose it has the following content:

+--------+-----+------------+
| name   | age | is_married |
+========+=====+============+
| John   | 55  | True       |
+--------+-----+------------+
| Mariah | 44  | yes        |
+--------+-----+------------+
| Carl   |     | false      |
+--------+-----+------------+
| Josh   | 12  | yes        |
+--------+-----+------------+
| Anna   | 32  | no         |
+--------+-----+------------+
| Josh   | 12  | true       |
+--------+-----+------------+

Maybe some of the rules that you want your data to follow are:

* there can't be any duplicate `name` in the table;
* a minimum of 3 `is_married` values should be True (or truthy);
* there can't be any null `age` value;

Even before we can apply these rules, we need to be sure that our data is being correctly parsed and converted to the right data types.
Take the `is_married` column for example: although it semantically represents a boolean value, its values are not consistent, since we have `True`, `yes` and `true` values to identify the same piece of information.

Thus, we need to guarantee that all data is correct and free of possible inconsistences, which would lead to errors in next steps of your data pipeline.

Let's consider another problem when you are working specifically with `pandas` for your data analysis. A known issue when dealing with integer values is that they are parsed as `float` type when there is a null value in the same column (which is converted to `NaN`), preserving this data type when you try to save or export the data:


.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pandas
    >>> pandas.read_csv('example.csv')
        name    age     is_married
    0   John    55.0    True
    1   Mariah  44.0    yes
    2   Carl    NaN     false
    3   Josh    12.0    yes
    4   Anna    32.0    no
    5   Josh    12.0    true
    >>> pandas.read_csv('example.csv').dtypes
    name           object
    age           float64
    is_married     object
    dtype: object

Even though strings are correctly parsed, the integer column became float.

Depending on the dataset you are working with, you will always have to remember to manually fix all sorts of issues caused by the Pandas' builtin datatype inference. If you just decide to read the file forcing the data type as string, you may get rid of part of the problem, but you still need to convert your columns manually to the right data type.

As a solution, Deirokay comes with the `data_reader` feature, which makes it easier for you to customize how your data must be parsed.


Parsing data with Deirokay Data Reader
======================================

For the Data Reader to work, you will need to pass as argument a :ref:`Deirokay Options Document`, which contains your instructions for how the data should be parsed. An example of such a document is shown below:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "columns": {
            "name": {
                "dtype": "string"
            },
            "age": {
                "dtype": "integer"
            },
            "is_married": {
                "dtype": "boolean",
                "truthies": ["yes", "true", "True"],
                "falsies": ["no", "false", "False"]
            }
        }
    }

To be able to use this option document you just need to import from Deirokay the DataReader, and will get a
pandas dataframe that doesn't have the initial problems:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from deirokay import data_reader
    >>> from deirokay.backend import Backend
    >>> data_reader('example.csv', options='options.json', backend=Backend.PANDAS)
         name   age  is_married
    0    John    55        True
    1  Mariah    44        True
    2    Carl  <NA>       False
    3    Josh    12        True
    4    Anna    32       False
    5    Josh    12        True

The `options` argument also accepts YAML files or `dict` objects directly.
When passing Deirokay file options as `dict`, you may optionally import the 
available data types from the `deirokay.enums.DTypes` enumeration class to prevent typos.

Validating data with Deirokay Validator
=======================================

The next step is to translate the rules we want into a Deirokay :ref:`Validation Item<Validation Items>`:

* there can't be any duplicate `name` in the table;

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "scope": "name",
    "statements": [
      {
        "type": "unique"
      }
    ]
  }

* a minimum of 3 `is_married` values should be True (or truthy);

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "scope": "is_married",
    "statements": [
      {
        "type": "contain",
        "rule": "all",
        "values": [ true ],
        "parser": { "dtype": "boolean" },
        "min_occurrences": 3
      }
    ]
  }

* there can't be any null `age` value;

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "scope": "age",
    "statements": [
      {
        "type": "not_null"
      }
    ]
  }

Below you can find our final :ref:`Validation Document`:

.. code-block:: json

  {
      "name": "example",
      "description": "Getting started with Deirokay",
      "items": [
          {
            "scope": "name",
            "statements": [
              {
                "type": "unique"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "scope": "is_married",
            "statements": [
              {
                "type": "contain",
                "rule": "all",
                "values": [ true ],
                "parser": { "dtype": "boolean" },
                "min_occurrences": 3
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "scope": "age",
            "statements": [
              {
                "type": "not_null"
              }
            ]
          }
      ]
  }

Finally, to test your dataset against the validation document:

.. code-block:: python

    from deirokay import data_reader
    from deirokay.backend import Backend

    df = data_reader('example.csv',
                     options='options.json',
                     backend=Backend.PANDAS)
    validation_result_document = validate(df,
                                          against='assertions.json',
                                          raise_exception=False)

The resulting validation document will present the reports for each
statement, as well as its final result: `pass` or `fail`. You may
probably want to save your validation result document by passing a path
to a folder (local or in S3) as `save_to` argument to `validate`. 
By default, the validation result document will be saved in the same file
format as the original validation document (you may specify another
format -- either `json` or `yaml` -- in the `save_format` argument).

Here is the resulting document in JSON format:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "name": "example",
    "description": "Getting started with Deirokay",
    "items": [
      {
        "scope": "name",
        "statements": [
          {
            "type": "unique",
            "report": {
              "detail": {
                "unique_rows": 4,
                "unique_rows_%": 66.66666666666667
              },
              "result": "fail"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "scope": "is_married",
        "statements": [
          {
            "type": "contain",
            "rule": "all",
            "values": [
              true
            ],
            "parser": {
              "dtype": "boolean"
            },
            "min_occurrences": 3,
            "report": {
              "detail": {
                "values": [
                  {
                    "value": true,
                    "count": 4,
                    "perc": 66.66666666666667
                  },
                  {
                    "value": false,
                    "count": 2,
                    "perc": 33.333333333333336
                  }
                ]
              },
              "result": "pass"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "scope": "age",
        "statements": [
          {
            "type": "not_null",
            "report": {
              "detail": {
                "null_rows": 1,
                "null_rows_%": 16.666666666666668,
                "not_null_rows": 5,
                "not_null_rows_%": 83.33333333333333
              },
              "result": "fail"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
